```

**Session browsing** (read-only): reads `.jsonl` files through SDK `SessionManager` helpers and `lib/session-reader.ts` — no AgentSession created.
**Sending a message**: `startRpcSession()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts` creates an AgentSession in-process.

## Dev Server Troubleshooting

- Before starting a server, run `lsof -nP -iTCP:30141 -sTCP:LISTEN` and reuse the existing Pi Web process when it is healthy. A second `next dev` for the same checkout cannot use a different port as a workaround because both processes contend for `.next/dev/lock`.
- A browser-only `Module ... factory is not available` overlay usually means that tab has a stale Turbopack/HMR graph; it does not prove the server or source is broken. First call the browser's explicit reload action, then compare the current server log and a direct HTTP/API request.
- Restart only after the failure reproduces from a fresh page and the server-side checks also fail. Stop the exact dev process gracefully, move `.next` into a `mktemp -d` backup, and restart with the standard `npm run dev` command.
- Do not use `next dev --webpack` as a fallback. This repository's development graph can fail on `undici` imports such as `node:console`; development is expected to use Turbopack.
- Adding a new Google Font (`next/font/google`) downloads it at compile time. Node does not use the system proxy; if the compile hangs on the first page load, restart dev with `HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 npm run dev` (local VPN port). Once fetched, the font is cached in `.next`.
- Next.js may append a generated `BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules` block to `AGENTS.md` when `next dev` starts. Treat that as generated tooling output, verify it with `git status`, and do not include it in an unrelated feature commit.
- Note: the globally-installed `@agegr/pi-web` production server (`next start`, port 30141) uses its own `.next` under the npm global package dir; a local `npm run dev` uses the checkout's `.next`. The two never contend for locks — the `.next/dev/lock` warning only applies to two `next dev` processes on the same checkout.

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### AgentSession lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id, keyed in `globalThis.__piSessions`
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not
- Idle timeout: 10 minutes. Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls share a single start Promise (`globalThis.__piStartLocks`)

### Fork must destroy the wrapper immediately
`AgentSession.fork()` **mutates the wrapper's inner state in-place** — after fork, `inner.sessionId` is the *new* session's id. If the wrapper stays alive in the registry under the old id, the next request gets the already-forked state and subsequent forks produce a corrupt `parentSession` chain.

**Fix**: `send("fork")` captures `newSessionId`, then calls `this.destroy()` before returning. The next request for the original session reloads a clean AgentSession from the original file.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them
- **Fork** (Fork button on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** (Continue button / BranchNavigator): calls `navigate_tree` within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files can be fully rewritten
`parentSession` in the header is **display metadata only** — has zero effect on chat content. Safe to `writeFileSync` the entire file (pi does this itself during migrations). Used when cascade-reparenting children on delete.

### ToolCall field normalization
Pi stores toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and `ChatWindow.handleAgentEvent()` (streaming).

### New session tool preset
Tool names are passed at session creation (`POST /api/agent/new` -> `toolNames[]`) and persisted in versioned `pi-web:tool-selection` custom entries. No entry means a legacy session and keeps Pi's default behavior; an empty array means Chat only. Chat only resolves before services are created, loads no extensions/skills/prompts/themes, and replaces Pi's base prompt with the ordered contents of Pi's discovered context files. Crossing the Chat-only boundary rebuilds the wrapper; changing between nonempty presets updates it in place. Subagents persist their active tools plus profile-level skill and extension loading switches in `resourceSnapshot`; loaded extensions cannot expose the reserved `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, or `steer_subagent` tools to a subagent. See `docs/adr/0002-chat-only-tool-selection.md`.

The last preset explicitly selected by the user is stored in browser `localStorage` and initializes fresh-session composers only. Existing sessions never trust that preference; they use their live `get_tools` state or pi's default when no wrapper exists.

### Model defaults for new sessions
`GET /api/models` returns `defaultModel` read from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. `ChatWindow` pre-selects this on mount for new sessions. Explicit browser model/thinking selections are applied atomically during AgentSession construction, then `lib/startup-preferences.ts` persists their effective values without replaying `set_model`/`set_thinking_level`; implicit `enabledModels` fallbacks and thinking pins are not persisted.

### `enabledModels` scoping
The `enabledModels` setting uses pi's `--models` syntax: minimatch globs against `provider/modelId` or a bare `modelId`, fuzzy matching for non-glob patterns, and an optional `:thinkingLevel` suffix. Never compare those patterns as literal strings — `lib/model-scope.ts` delegates to the SDK's `resolveModelScopeWithDiagnostics()` so pi-web and the TUI agree on the visible model list, and falls back to all available models when patterns resolve to nothing. `startRpcSession()` resolves that scope before creating an AgentSession and passes the selected initial model, thinking pin, and SDK-native `scopedModels` atomically; `GET /api/models` reuses the helper only for selector data, `thinkingLevelPins`, and `modelScopeWarnings` display.

### SSE reconnect on page refresh mid-stream
On `ChatWindow` mount, `GET /api/agent/[id]` is called. If `state.isStreaming === true`, SSE is reconnected automatically. `thinkingLevel` and `isCompacting` are also synced from this response.

### One event stream per tab
Browsers allow six HTTP/1.1 connections per origin, shared across every tab, and `next start` is HTTP/1.1 only. The chat stream, the terminal stream and a file watch each used to pin one connection each, so two tabs with a panel open could exhaust the pool and make *every* later request wait — including the POST that sends a prompt. Everything now rides `GET /api/events`:

- `GET /api/events` opens the connection and immediately sends a `$hub` `ready` frame carrying a `connectionId`.
- `POST /api/events/subscribe` adds/removes channels on it (`{connectionId, subscribe:[{channel, after}], sessionId}`). Channels are `agent:<sessionId>`, `terminal:<id>`, `file:<path>` and the id-less singleton `running`; keys split at the **first** colon so Windows paths survive.
- Frames are `{c, e, d, id}` — channel, event name (`message` when omitted), payload, resume cursor. One encoder and one 16 ms coalescing window serve every channel.
- `lib/event-hub-client.ts` is a browser singleton: it opens the EventSource lazily, closes it when the last channel unsubscribes, and on reconnect replays every channel with its last cursor. With the sidebar mounted the `running` channel keeps it alive, so a genuine zero-channel tab only exists before the first mount.
- Consumers keep their old semantics: `AgentEventConnection` still drives the readiness handshake through `lib/agent-hub-source.ts`, and the terminal's byte offset travels as the channel cursor.
- No producer may be duplicated: `openFileWatchChannel` is the only `fs.watch`, and the legacy `?type=watch` URL just re-frames it. `/api/agent/[id]/events` still works as a rollback path for one release; delete it once the hub has proven itself.

### Remote access through a tunnel
Over a tunnel the hop that matters is the public one, and the two Cloudflare products behave in opposite ways:
- **Quick tunnel** (`cloudflared --url`, `*.trycloudflare.com`) **buffers every GET response until it completes** and documents "no SSE". The hub stream then looks frozen and dumps everything at once on close. A heartbeat does not help — a 3-byte comment never reaches the ~128 KB flush threshold. WebSocket and POST responses do stream there, because they are not buffered response bodies. Never hand this app out over a quick tunnel.
- **Named tunnel** (own hostname, `credentials-file`) streams SSE normally, provided the response carries exactly `Content-Type: text/event-stream`. `/api/events` sets it plus `no-transform` and `X-Accel-Buffering: no`; keep those three together or Cloudflare may buffer to compress.
- Cloudflare drops an idle HTTP request after 100 s, so the 30 s hub heartbeat is load-bearing, not decorative. Anything above ~90 s breaks long turns on a quiet stream.
- Behind a tunnel the browser speaks HTTP/2 to the edge, so the six-connection limit that motivated the hub does not apply there — but it still does on `localhost`, which is the primary deployment. Keep the hub; just know that multiplexing now couples channels into one h2 stream, so one flooding terminal can delay agent tokens.

### Push beats poll on a slow link
On a wide-area link the expensive thing is not a byte, it is a round trip: a measured 230–335 ms from a mainland connection to the nearest Cloudflare edge, on a route that entered at one PoP and reached the tunnel connector at another. Anything that runs on a timer is therefore a tax that scales with how long the tab stays open, not with how much actually changed.

- `running` (see `lib/running-state.ts`) replaced two timers. `/api/agent/running` used to be fetched every 2.5 s for as long as the tab was visible (~24 requests/minute), and the shell settle path fetched `/api/agent/[id]` every second for the whole life of a command (~47/minute). Both now read the same in-process snapshot, which the hub pushes **only when it changes**, with one immediate frame on subscribe so a client never has to ask.
- The server watcher is refcounted: no channel subscribed means no interval, and the timer is `unref()`'d so it cannot hold the process open. Ticking in-process costs microseconds; ticking over the network cost a round trip each time.
- `bashRunningSessionIds` exists so the shell settle path can wait on the push instead of asking. Its 15 s timer is a backstop for a dead stream, not a cadence — and even then it is one verification request per completion, not one per second.
- Client-side fan-out lives in `lib/running-hub-client.ts`: the hub keeps one handler set per channel, so several components share a single subscription and late subscribers get the last snapshot replayed.

### SSE wire budget
The event stream is the only channel the browser has while a turn runs, so every byte spent there delays the next token.
- `toClientAgentEvent()` is the single choke point: it drops `turn_start`/`turn_end`, transcript system messages, and the cumulative `partial` on `message_update`. Never forward a pi event verbatim.
- `tool_execution_update` carries pi's **cumulative** `partialResult`, which is quadratic on the wire: a 64 KiB tool log cost 6.6 MiB of SSE traffic (101×) and stalled the stream behind its own backlog. The projection derives the one status line the UI renders (`getToolExecutionProgress` / `getCodemodeProgress`) and ships `progress` only. Measured 1.2× after the change — keep it flat, `lib/agent-event-wire.test.mjs` asserts it.
- `createAgentEventStream()` coalesces the high-frequency events (`message_update`, `tool_execution_update`) into one `enqueue` per 16 ms frame; state transitions flush immediately. One `enqueue` per token is one syscall and one small TCP segment per token; loopback hides that, a real network does not. The pending buffer is flushed before any close, so a final event is never lost to the window.
- Reconnect uses exponential backoff with full jitter (`AgentEventConnection`), not a fixed delay: each retry can cold-start an agent session, and a fixed 1 s delay turned a hiccup into a retry storm heavier than the outage. A healthy `connected` resets the backoff.

### Compaction SSE events
Newer pi emits `compaction_start` / `compaction_end`; older versions emitted `auto_compaction_start` / `auto_compaction_end`. `handleAgentEvent` accepts both sets to keep `isCompacting` in sync. Manual compact is a blocking POST — the button stays disabled until the response returns.

### Running state polling + reconciliation
- The sidebar polls `/api/agent/running` every 2.5 seconds while the tab is visible and pauses polling in background tabs. The session-list response remains the initial fallback.
- `useAgentSession` treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events and opens it before each prompt. `prompt_done` completes the current UI stage and notification immediately, but the idle SSE stays open for a 30-second grace window and is reused by the next prompt. `agent_start` cancels that close timer; `agent_settled` finishes extension-injected runs that have no wrapper-level `prompt_done` and starts a fresh grace window. Do not close on the first `agent_end`: retries, compaction, and extension-queued messages can continue the same logical prompt.
- While a run is active, `useAgentSession` periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed terminal events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.

### Worktrees and project grouping
- `lib/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.
- git prints POSIX-style absolute paths even on Windows, so every path read out of git goes through `toNativePath()` (`lib/paths.ts`) before it is compared or returned. Compare paths with `samePath()`, never `===` — raw equality made `isTopLevel` permanently false on Windows and hid the worktree switcher entirely. Branch names are not paths and must keep their forward slashes. Browser code cannot apply Node path rules, so `/api/worktrees` resolves `currentWorktreePath` server-side; the sidebar must use that identity for highlighting and removal fallback.

### File access allow-list
- `/api/files` is intentionally not a general filesystem browser. Allowed roots come from session cwds, their resolved project roots, `~/pi-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` call `allowFileRoot()` when they make a new location browsable.
- Allowed roots are stored slash-normalized, but that is a Set-key convention, not a correctness requirement: `isPathWithinRoots()` (`lib/path-security.ts`, the single implementation behind `isFilePathAllowed()`) re-resolves and case-folds both sides, so either path form authorizes correctly. Keep that one implementation — it is the security boundary.
- A UNC cwd (`\\host\share\dir`) must survive the `/api/files/[...path]` round-trip. `encodeFilePathForApi()` folds the `//` root into the first segment (`%2F%2Fhost`) because a literal `//` URL prefix is 308-normalized away before routing; `filePathFromApiSegments()` decodes it back. Never split UNC paths into segments and rejoin them — that silently turns `\\host\share` into the relative-looking `host/share` and every allow-check fails with 403.

### Plugins and skills
- `/api/plugins` uses pi's `SettingsManager` + `DefaultPackageManager` for global/project package install, remove, update, enable, and disable. Disabling writes empty `extensions/skills/prompts/themes` arrays for that package entry.
- `/api/skills` uses `DefaultResourceLoader` so settings paths, package skills, and project `.agents/skills` are listed the same way the runtime sees them.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent pi`; project installs run with the selected cwd.

### Built-in subagents
- The global `builtInEnabled` switch is persisted in `~/.pi/agent/agents/settings.json` and defaults to `false` when the file or field is absent. Malformed settings fail closed; atomic updates preserve unknown fields.
- The inline built-in extension factory is always present so reloading an existing wrapper can apply setting changes, but it registers no tools while disabled. After changing the switch, the user must explicitly reload the current session.
- When enabled, only a recognized legacy `pi-subagents` extension that registers any reserved tool (`Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, or `steer_subagent`) is removed. Unrelated extensions remain loaded, and resolved conflict diagnostics are discarded.
- Runtime `Agent` dispatch checks the setting again so a stale tool call cannot start a subagent after the feature is switched off.
- See `docs/adr/0003-built-in-subagent-toggle.md` for the precedence and persistence rationale.

### Auth and model config
- `ModelsConfig` combines models from `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with provider auth status from pi's `AuthStorage`/`ModelRegistry`.
- Provider listing is capability-driven, never id-driven: `lib/provider-listing.ts` decides membership from `auth.apiKey.login` / `auth.oauth` plus the stored credential type, so dual-auth providers (anthropic and github-copilot today — which providers declare both changes between SDK releases, so never assume it from an id) appear exactly once and never fall through both lists (#309). `lib/provider-listing-runtime.ts` adapts `ModelRuntime` to those pure helpers.
- auth.json holds **one** credential per provider and `ModelRuntime.logout()` deletes whichever it is. The delete routes therefore use `removeStoredCredentialIfType()` to compare and delete under the same file lock used by pi's auth storage. `ModelsConfig` also refreshes *both* provider lists after any auth change — refreshing one leaves a dual-auth provider rendered twice.
- OAuth/device-code/manual-code flows are streamed by `GET /api/auth/login/[provider]`; manual code responses POST back with a short-lived token stored in `globalThis.__piLoginCallbacks`.
- API-key routes store and remove keys through `AuthStorage`. Status endpoints must never return the raw key.
- The model test route is `app/api/models-config/test/route.ts`; `app/api/models/test/` is not a real route.

### Completion sound
- `hooks/useAudio.ts` stores the toggle in `localStorage` as `pi-sound-enabled` and reuses one `AudioContext`.
- Browser autoplay policy means sound must be unlocked from a user gesture; `ChatInput` calls the unlock hook from interactive controls, and `ChatWindow` plays the tone from `onAgentEnd`.

### Exported session HTML
- `/api/sessions/[id]/export` delegates to pi's export helper, then patches recursive tree helpers in the generated HTML to iterative versions so very deep linear sessions do not overflow the browser call stack.
